# CA description:
During the tutorial on creating a spell checker we created a basic spell checker
and some tests to spell check a file.
You are required to extend the spell checker so that it can spell check a
directory of files. You may use the glob.glob functionality in python to be able
to achieve this.
Please add appropriate unittests in order to test your newly created function(s).
